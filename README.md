# AI model optimization

### *How to build your own sentiment analysis solution based on Machine Learning?*

The aim here is to propose several **sentiment analysis models** and see which solution is the most relevant.

**USE CASE:** analyzing reviews sentiment on a clothing e-commerce site

*You can find out the dataset on [Hugging Face hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets/saattrupdan/womens-clothing-ecommerce-reviews)*

The repository contains the following elements:
- a notebook to learn how to train an **LSTM** model for sentiment analysis
- a notebook to learn how to fine-tune a **BERT** model for sentiment analysis
- a notebook to test an "on-shelf" solution **Lettria**
- a Python code to get the global comparaison of these models
